        <h2>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <p>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed. <br>
        The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. <br>
        The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. <br>
        The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clientâ€™s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. <br>
        The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. <br>
        The terms shim and polyfill are often used interchangeably. The main difference between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some missing functionality to a browser, although the implementation method may differ slightly from the standard API.  <br>
