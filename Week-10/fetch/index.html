        <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses. <br>
        The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. <br>
        The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings <br>
        A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side <br>
        Instead of passing a path to the resource you want to request into the fetch() call, you can create a request object using the Request() constructor, and pass that in as a fetch() method argument. <br>
        Fetch API support can be detected by checking for the existence of Headers, Request, Response or fetch() on the Window or Worker scope.  <br>
