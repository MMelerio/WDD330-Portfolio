        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. <br>
        Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience. However, client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! <br>
        Form validation: When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application <br>
        Built-in form validation uses HTML form validation features. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.  <br>
        JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library). <br>
        Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but it always requires you to think carefully about the user.  <br>
