        <h2>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG and Drag and Drop</h2>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.<br>
          canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.<br>
          SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML.<br>
          Vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down.<br>
          Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.<br>
          There are two major kinds of functionality you can implement with Drag and Drop: dragging files from your computer into a web page—in combination with the File API—or dragging elements into other elements on the same page<br>
